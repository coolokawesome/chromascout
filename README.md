# ChromaScout - Web Palette Scraper
ChromaScout is a web application designed to scrape the CSS files of a website and extract all the color values used, providing you with a color palette for that website. Input the URL of the website you want to scrape, and the application will fetch the CSS using multiple proxy API's to extract the files from that website. The CSS files are then analyzed using regular expressions to extract the color values used in the stylesheets. The extracted colors are then displayed as a color palette below.
